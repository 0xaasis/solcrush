# SolCrush 🍬

PvP match-3 on Solana. You stake, you play, winner gets paid — all on-chain, no backend holding your funds.

## What's this?

Basically Candy Crush but you're wagering real tokens against another player. Both players stake the same amount, play a 4-round match-3 game, and whoever scores higher wins the pot. The escrow is a PDA — neither player can touch the funds until the match resolves.

Built for the MagicBlock Gaming track at Graveyard Hack 2026.

```
you stake 5 USDC
opponent stakes 5 USDC
   → escrow PDA holds 10 USDC
   → you win
   → you get 9.75 USDC, treasury gets 0.25
```

No custodian. No trust required.

## The MagicBlock part

The real problem with on-chain gaming is that Solana's 400ms block time makes real-time gameplay feel broken. Every move can't be a transaction — that's unusable.

MagicBlock's ephemeral rollups fix this. The escrow gets created on L1, then the match account gets delegated to the rollup. Gameplay happens there — sub-100ms, zero fees per move. When the match ends, scores get committed back to L1 and the winner gets paid out.

The whole match = 3 L1 transactions. Everything in between is free.

```
initialize_match()  →  L1    (lock funds)
delegate_match()    →  L1 → Rollup
  ... gameplay on rollup ...
commit_match()      →  Rollup → L1
resolve_match()     →  L1    (pay winner)
```

## Program

Deployed on devnet: `7LLvnnLaqME25Kuf7Q6nUgFrrKKSWxUNdC62fFV21eZs`

[View on Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/7LLvnnLaqME25Kuf7Q6nUgFrrKKSWxUNdC62fFV21eZs?cluster=devnet)

Written in Anchor. Four core instructions:

- `initialize_match` — P1 creates the escrow PDA and deposits their stake
- `deposit_stake` — P2 joins and deposits their stake, match goes active
- `resolve_match` — verifies winner is actually P1 or P2, pays out, closes vault
- `cancel_match` — refund path if someone abandons (10 min timeout)

PDA seeds are `["escrow", match_id]` where match_id is 32 random bytes generated client-side. The resolve instruction marks status as Resolved before the transfer, uses checked arithmetic throughout, and reclaims rent from the vault on close.

## Anti-cheat

Both players submit their full move log at match end. The server replays both logs on the same seeded board and checks if scores match. Same moves on the same seed always produce the same result — scores can't be faked.

## Stack

- Anchor 0.29 / Rust for the program
- MagicBlock Ephemeral Rollups SDK
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript frontend
- `@solana/wallet-adapter` — Phantom, Solflare, Coinbase Wallet
- SPL token for USDC, native SOL support
